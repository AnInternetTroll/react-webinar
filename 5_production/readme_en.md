# Advanced usage

When we combine React with SSR we can make applications which are easy to write
and fast and dynamic. Here we are using a framework called
[Fresh](https://github.com/lucacasonato/fresh). It's really experimental but
it's easy to show off. Behind the scenes Fresh will take your JSX code, and turn
it into HTML, so the browser doesn't get any JavaScript unless it absolutely
needs to.

Fresh also allows you to run server side code before the client gets the HTML,
so you can get data from a database or other stuff.

# Notable libraries

In Deno:

- [AlephJS](https://alephjs.org)

In node JS:

- NextJS
- Vite

Finn.no uses NextJS I'm super sure but I can't prove it just yet I'm not crazy I
swear.
