# Classes vs Functions
Use classes if Geir will ever see your code. 
Functions are better in all other scenarios.

# Hey, this kinda looks like
- [TC39's Class field declarations proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields)
- [Vue Components](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/#Composing-with-Components)
- [Svelte's custom elements](https://svelte.dev/docs#Custom_element_API)

So this style of coding is popular.
~~I'm not gonna even look up angular~~
